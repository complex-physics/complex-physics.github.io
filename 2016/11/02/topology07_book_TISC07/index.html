<li>Chapter-7 Graphene</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="chapter-7-graphene">Chapter-7 Graphene</h2>
<p>In the previous chapters, we have primarily investigated phenomena on the square lattice. In this chapter, we switch gears and look at another two-dimensional lattice, the hexagonal, or honeycomb, lattice. This is not just a simple variation of our work so far. The hexagonal lattice is important for of both experimental and theoretical reasons. Experimentally, the hexagonal lattice is realized in graphene, an amazing material of fundamental importance and interest. The synthesis of graphene sheets via the "scotch tape" method was awarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics for 2010. Graphene is currently a popular subject of research and is likely to remain so for many years. From a theoretical point of view, graphene is also interesting: it has two sites per unit cell (A-sites and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> -sites), so the minimal model for graphene has to be a two-band model. It turns out that the hexagonal lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping is a semimetal with gapless Dirac fermions at the Fermi level. Gaps for these Dirac fermions can be opened in different ways, and the insulator obtained can exhibit fascinating properties, such as a zero-field quantized Hall effect (i.e., the Chern insulator or quantum anomalous Halleffect state).</p>
<p>We focus on graphene in this long chapter, We show that the nearest-neighbor-hopping model of graphene has Dirac nodes and then ask what symmetries protect the nodes from opening a gap. We learn that in two spatial dimensions, both inversion and TR symmetry are needed to keep Dirac fermions gapless. These two conditions endow Dirac fermions with a "reality" constraint, and we relate their gaplessness to the Wigner-vonNeumann classification. We then keep inversion and time reversal intact but break the <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> symmetry of the graphene nearest-neighbor model and show that, although Dirac nodes are locally stable, they are not globally stable: two Dirac nodes can annihilate and open a gap. This can happen, however,only if the two nodes have opposite "vorticity," which is the same effect the Berry phase accumulated around a constant-energy contour encircling the Dirac point. We hence learn that the Berry phase is a vorticity that keeps Dirac nodes locally stable. We then move on to show that gapless graphene has edge modes that link the two Dirac nodes. We obtain analytic solutions for these modes and then argue that the opening of different types of gaps at the Dirac nodes gives rise to different types of insulators. This provides a simple and heuristic way of understanding the Chern insulator presented in a later chapter of this book.</p>
<h2 id="hexagonal-lattices">Hexagonal Lattices</h2>
<p>The graphene lattice, shown in figure <span class="math inline">\(7.1\)</span>, has the following translation vectors: <span class="math display">\[
a _{1}=\frac{a}{2}(3, \sqrt{3}), \quad a _{2}=\frac{a}{2}(3,-\sqrt{3})
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the bond length. The vectors give rise to the reciprocal lattice vectors <span class="math display">\[
b _{1}=\frac{2 \pi}{3 a}(1, \sqrt{3}), \quad b _{2}=\frac{2 \pi}{3 a}(1,-\sqrt{3}),
\]</span> which satisfy <span class="math inline">\(b _{i} \cdot a _{j}=2 \pi \delta_{i j} .\)</span> Notice that the lattice has a two-site unit cell because <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> -sites (see fig. 7.1) can be moved into <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> -sites only by the primitive wavevectors. In practice, the <span class="math inline">\(BZ\)</span> can be taken to be the parallelogram formed by the wavevectors <span class="math inline">\(b _{1}, b _{2}\)</span>, although in most work on the subject, the <span class="math inline">\(BZ\)</span> is taken to be the hexagon with the two vertices at points <span class="math inline">\(\left(K, K^{\prime}\right)\)</span>, where <span class="math display">\[
K =\frac{2 \pi}{3 a}\left(1, \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right), \quad K ^{\prime}=\frac{2 \pi}{3 a}\left(1,-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) .
\]</span> These two points are TR partners of each other, which is clear in the parallelogram <span class="math inline">\(BZ\)</span> but which can easily be shown to be the case in the hexagonal BZas well because <span class="math inline">\(- K = K ^{\prime}- b _{1}- b _{2}\)</span>. The simplest tight-binding Hamiltonian for graphene contains hoppings to nearest- neighbor sites. It is a <span class="math inline">\(2 \times 2\)</span> Hamiltonian, which is easy to diagonalize in the <span class="math inline">\(\left(c_{A}, c_{B}\right)\)</span> basis of second quantized operators for sites <span class="math inline">\(A, B\)</span>. For hopping <span class="math inline">\(t_{1}, t_{2}, t_{3}\)</span> along the <span class="math inline">\(\delta _{1}, \delta _{2}, \delta _{3}\)</span> bonds (see fig. 7.1) the Hamiltonian Fourier- transformed in momentum space is <span class="math display">\[
H=\sum_{k}\left(\begin{array}{ll}
c_{A k}^{\dagger} &amp; c_{B k}^{\dagger}
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; \sum_{i=1}^{3} t_{i} e^{i k \cdot \delta_{i}} \\
\sum_{i=1}^{3} t_{i} e^{-i k \cdot \delta_{i}} &amp; 0
\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{l}
c_{A k} \\
c_{B k}
\end{array}\right)
\]</span> The distances between the three nearest neighbors of one of the sites is <span class="math display">\[
\delta _{1}=\frac{a}{2}(1, \sqrt{3}), \quad \delta _{2}=\frac{a}{2}(1,-\sqrt{3}), \quad \delta _{3}=a(-1,0) .
\]</span> Unfortunately, in this basis, the Hamiltonian is not in Bloch form, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(h( k + G ) \neq h( k )\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(G=b_{1}, b_{2}\)</span>, because <span class="math inline">\(b _{i} \cdot \delta _{j} \neq 2 \pi \delta_{i j} .\)</span> We could work in this basis and forego Bloch form, but this would not be consistent with results in the past chapters and would also preempt the automatic identification of time reversal invariant points <span class="math inline">\(G / 2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(- G / 2\)</span>, up to reciprocal lattice wavevectors. We decide to restore Bloch form by making a gauge transformation of the preceding Hamiltonian on <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> -sites, <span class="math display">\[
c_{B k} \rightarrow c_{B k} e^{i k \cdot \delta_{3}}
\]</span> to get the Bloch Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(H=\sum_{ k } c_{ k }^{\dagger} h(k) c_{ k }\)</span>, where <span class="math display">\[
h(k)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 &amp; -t_{a} e^{i k \cdot a _{1}}-t_{b} e^{i k \cdot a _{2}}-t_{c} \\
-t_{a} e^{-i k \cdot a _{1}}-t_{b} e^{-i k \cdot a _{2}}-t_{c} &amp; 0
\end{array}\right)
\]</span> The gauge transformation that makes the Hamiltonian of Bloch form corresponds to a different gauge choice of orbitals in the graphene lattice.</p>
<h2 id="dirac-fermions">Dirac Fermions</h2>
<p>The simple tight-binding graphene Hamiltonian displays the interesting physics of massless Dirac fermions. For the case of isotropic-hopping matrix elements <span class="math inline">\(t_{a}=t_{b}=t_{c}=1\)</span>, if we expanded around the points <span class="math inline">\(K , K ^{\prime}\)</span>, at <span class="math inline">\(k = K + \kappa\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(\kappa \ll K\)</span>, we find that the Hamiltonian has the Dirac form <span class="math display">\[
h( K + \kappa )=\kappa_{x} \sigma_{x}+\kappa_{y} \sigma_{y}
\]</span> Expanding around <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}\)</span> to first order, we obtain another Dirac Hamiltonian: <span class="math display">\[
h\left( K ^{\prime}\right)=H(- K + \kappa )=-\kappa_{x} \sigma_{x}+\kappa_{y} \sigma_{y}
\]</span> There are no other independent Dirac nodes in the problem. The presence of these nodes renders graphene to be a semimetal, with fundamentally different properties from an insulator, because low-energy excitations are always present in such a system.</p>
<p>The question one should now ask is whether these Dirac points are stable to perturbations. Our expansion of the Hamiltonian has showned us the existence of two Dirac fermions. However, the Hamiltonian we used was by no means generic. For example, it contained only nearest-neighbor coupling with <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> symmetry, and it did not allow for different on-site energies of the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> -sites in the unit cell, etc. Would adding small perturbations to the graphene lattice result in the gapping of these Dirac fermions? What are the perturbations we are allowed to add while keeping the system a semimetal? What kind of perturbations open a gap? For all these questions, we need to look at the symmetries of graphene. ## Symmetries of a Graphene Sheet</p>
<p>Two main symmetries characterize the hexagonal lattice with identical atoms on <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> -sites. The first symmetry is time reversal, which is present regardless of the spatial distribution of hopping matrix elements, as long as they are real. The second symmetry, inversion, is present if hoppings in the lattice are symmetric upon inversion with the inversion center either in the middle of the unit cell bond or in the middle of the hexagonal lattice: it is clearly present</p>
<h3 id="time-reversal">1 Time Reversal</h3>
<p>As previously discussed, time reversal for spinless fermion Bloch Hamiltonians takes the form <span class="math display">\[
\operatorname{Th}( k ) T^{-1}=h(- k ) \longrightarrow h( k )^{*}=h(- k )
\]</span> If we impose TR invariance on the system, this symmetry fixes the form of the Hamiltonian at <span class="math inline">\(K^{\prime}\)</span> once the Hamiltonian at <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is known <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{c}
h( K + \kappa )^{*}=h(- K - \kappa )=\left(\kappa_{x} \sigma_{x}+\kappa_{y} \sigma_{y}\right)^{*}=\kappa_{x} \sigma_{x}-\kappa_{y} \sigma_{y} \\
\longrightarrow h(- K + \kappa )=-\kappa_{x} \sigma_{x}+\kappa_{y} \sigma_{y}
\end{array}
\]</span> Notice that <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> by itself does not protect the Dirac fermions from opening a gap as long as the gap at points <span class="math inline">\(K, K^{\prime}\)</span> has special properties: if at <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> we have a Bloch Hamiltonian <span class="math inline">\(h( K + \kappa )=\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\kappa_{x} \sigma_{x}+\kappa_{y} \sigma_{y}+m \sigma_{z}\)</span>, whereas at <span class="math inline">\(K^{\prime}\)</span> we have the Bloch Hamiltonian <span class="math display">\[
h(- K - \kappa )=h( K + \kappa )^{*}=\kappa_{x} \sigma_{x}-\kappa_{y} \sigma_{y}+m \sigma_{z}
\]</span> the system preserves time reversal. This type of mass, which preserves <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> but opens a gap in the Dirac spectrum, physically represents a different on-site energy for the atoms on the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> -sites and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> -sites. It corresponds to adding a momentum-independent term <span class="math inline">\(m \sigma_{z}\)</span> in the full Bloch Hamiltonian. For example, the Hamiltonian of boron nitride, (BN) a system that also has a hexagonal lattice structure but, as the name suggests, as different atoms on the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> - and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> -sites, has this form and is a gapped insulator.</p>
<h3 id="inversion-symmetry">2 Inversion Symmetry</h3>
<p>The graphene lattice has another symmetry which is spatial inversion (see fig. <span class="math inline">\(7.2\)</span> for the <span class="math inline">\(t_{1}, t_{2}, t_{3}\)</span> -hopping model and inversion center). If the hopping and on-site matrix elements do not change upon the action of the inversion operator <span class="math display">\[
I:(x, y) \rightarrow(-x,-y)
\]</span> we have that the Hamiltonian also has inversion symmetry. Inversion is a unitary operator. It does not contain the complex conjugation operator, and it leaves the <span class="math inline">\([x, p]\)</span> commutator unchanged, due to the fact that both <span class="math inline">\(x, p\)</span> change under inversion, unlike in the <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> case, in which only <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> transformed under inversion. Under inversion with respect to the middle of the unit cell, the second quantized operators transform as <span class="math display">\[
I c_{i, A} I^{-1}=c_{-i, B}, \quad I c_{i, B} I^{-1}=c_{-i, A}
\]</span> or, in compact form, <span class="math display">\[
I c_{i, a} I^{-1}=\sigma_{a, a^{\prime}}^{\chi} c_{-i, a^{\prime}}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a=A, B\)</span>. The Fourier component of the second quantized operators transforms as <span class="math display">\[
I c_{ k , a} I^{-1}=\sigma_{a, a^{\prime}}^{x} \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{j} e^{-i k r_{j}} c_{j a^{\prime}}=\sigma_{a a^{\prime}}^{x} c_{- k , a^{\prime}}
\]</span> For the inversion-symmetric second quantized graphene Hamiltonian with <span class="math inline">\([H, I]=0\)</span>, we find the transformation on the Bloch Hamiltonian: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
I H I^{-1} &amp;=\sum_{ k } \sigma_{\theta a}^{x} c_{- k \theta}^{\dagger} I h_{a \beta}( k ) I^{-1} \sigma_{\beta, \delta}^{x} c_{- k \delta}=\sum_{ k } \sigma_{\theta a}^{x} c_{- k \theta}^{\dagger} h_{a \beta}( k ) \sigma_{\beta, \delta}^{\chi} c_{- k \delta} \\
&amp;=\sum_{ k } \sigma_{\theta a}^{x} c_{ k \theta}^{\dagger} h_{a \beta}(- k ) \sigma_{\beta, \delta}^{\chi} c_{ k \delta} .
\end{aligned}
\]</span> If inversion is a good symmetry, then <span class="math inline">\(I H I^{-1}=H\)</span> and, hence, <span class="math display">\[
h( k )=\sigma_{x} h(- k ) \sigma_{x}
\]</span> In this equation, the matrix representation of the inversion operator is <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x}\)</span> in the graphene lattice. We will later see other representations, such as <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{z} .\)</span></p>
<p>By itself, inversion also does not guarantee the stability of the Dirac points. If at <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> we open a gap <span class="math inline">\(m, h( K + \kappa )=\kappa_{x} \sigma_{x}+\kappa_{y} \sigma_{y}+m \sigma_{z}\)</span>, then we can have a perfectly inversion-symmetric Hamiltonian if the Hamiltonian at the <span class="math inline">\(K^{\prime}\)</span> point is <span class="math display">\[
h(- K - \kappa )=\sigma_{x}\left(\kappa_{x} \sigma_{x}+\kappa_{y} \sigma_{y}+m \sigma_{z}\right) \sigma_{x}=\kappa_{x} \sigma_{x}-\kappa_{y} \sigma_{y}-m \sigma_{z}
\]</span> This type of mass, however, cannot come from a momentum-independent term (in the full Bloch Hamiltonian). Indeed, a full lattice realization of such a mass term was first found by Haldane in the first example of a topological insulator, the Chern insulator. We analyze it in chapter 8 .</p>
<h3 id="local-stability">3 Local Stability</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Local Stability of Dirac Points with Inversion and Time Reversal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason that inversion and time reversal separately do not protect the Dirac fermions is because they both link a generic <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(- k\)</span>, thereby not really imposing any constraints on the Hamiltonian at a generic <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. However, when both these symmetries are present and when they are used together, they relate <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and impose constraints on the form of the Bloch Hamiltonian at each <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> separately: <span class="math display">\[
h( k )=\sigma_{x} h(- k ) \sigma_{x}=h^{*}(- k ) \longrightarrow h( k )=\sigma_{x} h^{*}( k ) \sigma_{x}
\]</span> The first equality uses <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, and the second uses <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>. The equation (29) is the matrix representation of the operator product of inversion and time reversal, <span class="math inline">\(\left.(T I) h( k )(T I)^{-1}=h( k )\right)\)</span>. For a generic, two-level Hamiltonian of Bloch form, <span class="math display">\[
H=d_{i}( k ) \sigma_{i}+\epsilon( k ) I_{2 \times 2}
\]</span> <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and inversion impose the conditions (we drop the explicit <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> -dependence) <span class="math display">\[
d_{i} \sigma_{i}+\epsilon=\sigma_{x}\left(d_{i} \sigma_{i}+\epsilon\right)^{*} \sigma_{x}=d_{x} \sigma_{x}+d_{y} \sigma_{y}-d_{z} \sigma_{z}+\epsilon
\]</span> We see that as a result of the combined inversion and time reversal, we obtain <span class="math display">\[
d_{z}( k )=-d_{z}( k )=0
\]</span> As such, if both inversion and time reversal are respected, no <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{z}\)</span> term can arise, and the Dirac points are locally stable. What does this mean for a Dirac Hamiltonian? If, around the point <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> in the BZ, the Hamiltonian is <span class="math inline">\(k_{x} \sigma_{x}+k_{y} \sigma_{y}\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the deviation from <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> ), we are not allowed to add a <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{z}\)</span> -term to the Hamiltonian by any perturbation. Although <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{x}\)</span> -and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{y}\)</span> -terms are not forbidden by time reversal and inversion, their only result, if small, is to shift the Dirac points in momentum space. Explicitly, <span class="math display">\[
H^{\prime}=k_{x} \sigma_{x}+k_{y} \sigma_{y}+a_{1} \sigma_{x}+a_{2} \sigma_{y}
\]</span> and as long as <span class="math inline">\(a_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_{2}\)</span> are small, <span class="math inline">\(H^{\prime}\)</span> has nodes at <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}=-a_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}=-a_{2}\)</span>. Hence, with inversion and time reversal, a single Dirac node is locally stable-no small perturbation can open a gap. Large perturbations can and do open a gap, but the gap-opening mechanism is very different.</p>
<p>As long as the Dirac fermions at <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(- K\)</span> are forbidden to open a gap by <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and inversion, they carry a vortex in the Bloch wavefunction, which is the same as saying that their Berry phase <span class="math inline">\(\int A_{i}(\kappa) d \kappa_{i}\)</span> (where <span class="math inline">\(A_{i}(\kappa)\)</span> is the Berry potential and the integral is performed over any closed contour enclosing the Dirac point) equals <span class="math inline">\(\pm \pi\)</span>. Because the matrix <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{z}\)</span> is forbidden (whether multiplied by a constant term or even by an even or odd power of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> ), we thus have that the Hamiltonian at both <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}\)</span> can be written as a matrix: <span class="math inline">\(H(k)=\kappa_{i} A_{i j} \sigma_{j} .\)</span> The Berry phase of such a Dirac fermion is given by <span class="math inline">\(\pi \operatorname{sign}(\operatorname{Det}(A))\)</span>, which we be prove later. Note that the lack of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{z}\)</span> is important because it allows us to write the Hamiltonian with both <span class="math inline">\(i, j=1,2\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(H(\kappa)=\kappa_{i} A_{i a} \sigma_{a}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(a=1,2,3-\)</span> in this case <span class="math inline">\(A_{i a}\)</span> would not be a square matrix and defining a determinant (vorticity) would be impossible. The fact that vorticities can be defined when the dimension of the BZ (in this case, 2 ) is equal to the codimension of the crossing (in this case, also 2 because we have two Pauli matrices) is no accident. The Wigner-vonNeumann classification says that a generic crossing has codimension 3 - we need to tune three parameters to obtain a degeneracy because there exist three anticommuting Pauli matrices whose coefficients need to be tuned to zero. However, the BZ provides for two parameters <span class="math inline">\(\left(k_{x}, k_{y}\right)\)</span>, which are tuned automatically, leaving us with only one tunable parameter needed to obtain a degeneracy. This would be the Dirac fermion mass, which would need to be fine-tuned to vanish. But, if time reversal and inversion are present, then the matrix that would couple to this remaining tunable parameter cannot exist, and degeneracies can happen without tuning-i.e., they are locally stable. The presence of inversion and time reversal is said to impose a reality condition on the Hamiltonian (the Hamiltonian can be made real by a gauge transformation).</p>
<p>For the Dirac fermion at <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(A_{11}=A_{22}=1\)</span>, whereas for the one at <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(A_{11}=-A_{22}=-k .\)</span> Hence, the Berry phase, which is <span class="math inline">\(\pi \operatorname{sign}(\operatorname{Det}(A))\)</span>, is opposite for the two fermions. In graphene, the Dirac fermion at <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> carries Berry phase <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, whereas the Dirac fermion at <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}=- K\)</span> carries Berry phase <span class="math inline">\(-\pi\)</span>. Because the wavefunctions have vorticity, the nodes cannot be removed by themselves. For example, for the Dirac fermion at <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>, the wavefunction has a vortex (which gives it a Berry phase <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> ) and the inclusion of extra terms that break the <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> symmetry (for example,the simplest way is to make <span class="math inline">\(t_{1} \neq t_{2} \neq t_{3}\)</span> ) but respect <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> can only move the Dirac point away from <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> but cannot open a gap.</p>
<h2 id="global-stability-of-dirac-points">Global Stability of Dirac Points</h2>
<p>The stability of the Dirac nodes proved in the previous section is valid for any perturbation that respects <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, as long as it is small. For example, we can break <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> and make the hopping on the bonds different, or we can add second and third nearest-neighbor hoppings. The second nearest-neighbor hopping does nothing because it is diagonal in the sublattice space (couples identical sublattices). What happens if the perturbation is large? What happens if we add large, arbitrary-range hopping terms in our Bloch Hamiltomian? It is clear that the Hamiltonian can be gapped. For example, pick <span class="math inline">\(t_{a}=t_{b}=0\)</span> in our graphene model, i.e., make a model of very anisotropic graphene with nonzero hopping in only one direction. The energy levels would then be <span class="math inline">\(\pm t_{c}\)</span>, thereby giving a fully gapped Hamiltonian. How did this happen? It turns out that Dirac modes can and will open a gap by coming together and annihilating at a TR-symmetric point; at this point, the dispersion has to be quadratic in one direction. This section analyzes this aspect of the problem. We show that if the Hamiltonian has <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> symmetry (on top of <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> ), then the Dirac nodes are globally stable, and their position is fixed at the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}\)</span> points in the BZ. If, however, <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> symmetry is broken, then the Dirac nodes can move off the K, K' points-and, upon large-enough perturbations, the two Dirac nodes can meet up and annihilate at a TR-invariant point in the BZ.</p>
<h3 id="c_3-symmetry-and-the-position-of-the-dirac-nodes">1 <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> Symmetry and the Position of the Dirac Nodes</h3>
<p>We now prove that, in the case where the Hamiltonian has the three symmetries <span class="math inline">\(T, I\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span>, the position of the Dirac nodes does not change and stays at <span class="math display">\[
K =\frac{2 \pi}{3 a}\left(1, \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right), \quad K ^{\prime}=\frac{2 \pi}{3 a}\left(1,-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) .
\]</span> As stated previously, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> guarantee the absence of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{z}\)</span> terms in the Hamiltonian. However, with just <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, the hopping can be anisotropic, the simplest example being a model with different nearest-neighbor hoppings. An extra <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> symmetry, i.e., rotation by <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2 \pi}{3}\)</span> around a hexagon center in the lattice or around the points <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, adds extra constraints to the system. The <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> symmetry is manifest by the fact that the hopping matrix elements must be invariant upon the cyclic change of <span class="math display">\[
\delta _{1} \rightarrow \delta _{2} \rightarrow \delta _{3} \rightarrow \delta _{1}
\]</span> where, as previously defined, <span class="math inline">\(\delta _{1}=\frac{a}{2}(1, \sqrt{3}), \delta _{2}=\frac{a}{2}(1,-\sqrt{3}), \delta _{3}=a(-1,0)\)</span> are the <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span> bond vectors. This <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> transformation is obvious if we take the <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2 \pi}{3}\)</span> rotation center to be either the center of the hexagon, one of the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> -sites, or one of the <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> -sites. Notethat this symmetry implies equal hopping parameters for the nearest-neighbor hopping <span class="math inline">\(A \rightarrow B\)</span>, but, in general, for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> th next nearest-neighbor hopping, it does not imply equal hopping parameters. For example, for the hopping matrix element from site <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to the third-nearest-neighbor site <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> (there are two third-nearest neighbor sites <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, as given in fig. 7.3), we have perfect <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> symmetry even though the six matrix elements can break up into two different matrix elements: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{l}
t_{1 n n n}\left(e^{i k \cdot\left(\delta_{1}-\delta_{3}+\delta_{1}\right)}+e^{i k \cdot\left(\delta_{3}-\delta_{2}+\delta_{3}\right)}+e^{i k \cdot\left(\delta_{2}-\delta_{1}+\delta_{2}\right)}\right) \\
+t_{2 m n n}\left(e^{i k \cdot\left(\delta_{1}-\delta_{2}+\delta_{1}\right)}+e^{i k \cdot\left(\delta_{3}-\delta_{1}+\delta_{3}\right)}+e^{i k \cdot\left(\delta_{2}-\delta_{3}+\delta_{2}\right)}\right),
\end{array}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(t_{1 n m n} \neq t_{2 m n n} .\)</span> In other words, <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> symmetry does not require symmetry over all permutations of <span class="math inline">\(\delta_{1,2,3}\)</span>, but over only the cyclic permutations. It is clear from figure <span class="math inline">\(7.3\)</span> that the preceding term respects <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> even though <span class="math inline">\(t_{1 m n n} \neq t_{2 n m n}\)</span></p>
<p>To see the effect of the <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> symmetry on the graphene band structure, we first analyze the nearest-neighbor Hamiltonian-where hopping occurs only through the nearest-neighbor bond. It is convenient to work in the basis in which the hopping occurs through <span class="math inline">\(\delta _{1}, \delta _{2}, \delta _{3}\)</span>. It is in this basis that the <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> symmetry is easily imposed, and we can go to the basis <span class="math inline">\(1, a _{1}, a _{2}\)</span> through a gauge transformation. The off-diagonal matrix element of this Hamiltonian is <span class="math display">\[
-t\left(e^{i k \cdot \delta_{1}}+e^{i k \cdot \delta_{2}}+e^{i k \cdot \delta_{3}}\right)=-t e^{i k \cdot \delta_{3}}\left(1+e^{i k a _{2}}+e^{i k \cdot a _{1}}\right) .
\]</span> The gapless point happens at the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> for which <span class="math display">\[
1+e^{i k \cdot a _{2}}+e^{i k \cdot a _{1}}=0
\]</span> Because these are complex numbers of unit absolute value, they can be represented by a vector on the unit circle. The vector 1 is on the positive real axis, whereas the other two vectors, <span class="math inline">\(e^{i k \cdot a _{2}}, e^{i k \cdot a _{1}}\)</span>, are above and below the real negative axis at the same angle so that their imaginary part cancels; however, their real parts add up to cancel <span class="math inline">\(1 .\)</span> The only two solutions are <span class="math inline">\(K \cdot a _{2}=\frac{2 \pi}{3}, K \cdot a _{1}=\frac{4 \pi}{3}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime} \cdot a _{1}=\frac{2 \pi}{3}, K ^{\prime} \cdot a _{2}=\frac{4 \pi}{3}\)</span>, which are, of course, time reversals of each other (up to reciprocal lattice vectors). The gapless equality can then be written as <span class="math display">\[
1+z+z^{2}=0 ; \quad z=e^{i K \cdot a _{2}}=e^{i \frac{2 \pi}{3}}, \quad z^{2}=e^{i K \cdot a _{1}}=e^{i \frac{4 \pi}{3}} \quad z^{3}=1,
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is the third primitive root of unity. We now show that longer- range hopping not only cannot open a gap in perturbation theory (which was known from the local stability of Dirac points studied in section 7.3.3) but also cannot move the Dirac points <span class="math inline">\(K , K ^{\prime}\)</span>, no matter how large the perturbation. However, we cannot guarantee the absence of other gapless points in the BZ upon the introduction of longer-range hopping. To prove that the gapless points are stable, we have to prove that any off-diagonal matrix element vanishes at <span class="math inline">\(k = K\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> symmetry is present (if so, T guarantees that the matrix element will also vanish at <span class="math inline">\(\left.K ^{\prime}\right)\)</span>. Consider one <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> -site and the hoppings from it to the other sites. The hoppings are of two kinds: 1. There are hoppings that go through an even number of bonds (i.e., the vector that links a certain <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> -site with the site we want to hop onto can be expressed as a linear combination of a total even number of <span class="math inline">\(\delta _{1,2,3}-\)</span> the number of <span class="math inline">\(\delta _{1}, \delta _{2}, \delta _{3}\)</span>, when added, is even). These hoppings couple sites in the same sublattice, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Because we cannot have any <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{z}\)</span> matrix by <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> combined, the term induced by these hoppings must be diagonal and proportional to the identity matrix (this is true even if <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> symmetry is absent, just due to <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I)\)</span>. Hence, these terms are just an energy shift, which breaks the perfect particle-hole symmetry of graphene but cannot open a gap at the Dirac points. 2. More importantly, there are hoppings that go through an odd number of bonds and that couple <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> -sites with <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> -sites. These are important and must be treated with care. Its obvious that on the graphene lattice, <span class="math inline">\(\delta _{1,2,3}\)</span> span the space, so any vector can be written in terms of them, but more importantly, any vector coupling an <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> -site and a <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> -site can be written in the form <span class="math display">\[
v _{A B}=n_{1} \delta _{1}+n_{2} \delta _{2}+n_{3} \delta _{3}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n_{1,2,3}\)</span> are integers that crucially satisfy <span class="math display">\[
n_{1}+n_{2}+n_{3}=1 \bmod 3
\]</span> The preceding is true because of the chosen vector orientation of <span class="math inline">\(\delta _{1,2,3}\)</span>. We write each <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> as a multiple of 3 plus a remainder: <span class="math display">\[
n_{i}=3 p_{i}+a_{i}, \quad i=1,2,3
\]</span> where, of course, <span class="math inline">\(a_{i} \in[0,1,2]\)</span> and, crucially, because of equation (7.30), <span class="math display">\[
a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}=-3\left(p_{1}+p_{2}+p_{3}\right)+1=1 \bmod 3
\]</span> Per <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> symmetry, the off-diagonal matrix element coupling sites <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is a cyclic permutation of <span class="math inline">\(e^{i k \cdot v _{A B}}\)</span> over the cyclic permutation of <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> 's: <span class="math display">\[
e^{i k \cdot\left(n_{1} \delta _{1}+n_{2} \delta _{2}+n_{3} \delta _{3}\right)}+e^{i k \cdot\left(n_{1} \delta _{2}+n_{2} \delta _{3}+n_{3} \delta _{1}\right)}+e^{i k \cdot\left(n_{1} \delta _{3}+n_{2} \delta _{1}+n_{3} \delta _{2}\right)}
\]</span> We also have <span class="math inline">\(a _{1}= \delta _{1}- \delta _{3}, \quad a _{2}= \delta _{2}- \delta _{3}\)</span> and so the above matrix element becomes: <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{l}
\exp \left(i k \cdot\left(n_{1} \delta _{1}+n_{2} \delta _{2}+n_{3} \delta _{3}\right)\right)+\exp \left(i k \cdot\left(n_{1} \delta _{2}+n_{2} \delta _{3}+n_{3} \delta _{1}\right)\right)+\exp \left(i k \cdot\left(n_{1} \delta _{3}+n_{2} \delta _{1}+n_{3} \delta _{2}\right)\right) \\
=\exp \left(i k \cdot \delta _{3}\right)\left[\exp \left(i k \cdot\left(3 p_{1} a _{1}+3 p_{2} a _{2}\right)\right) \exp \left(i k \cdot\left(a_{1} a _{1}+a_{2} a _{2}\right)\right)\right. \\
\quad+\exp \left(i k \cdot\left(3 p_{1} a _{2}+3 p_{3} a _{1}\right)\right) \exp \left(i k \cdot\left(a_{1} a _{2}+a_{3} a _{1}\right)\right) \\
\left.+\exp \left(i k \cdot\left(3 p_{2} a _{1}+3 p_{3} a _{2}\right)\right) \exp \left(i k \cdot\left(a_{2} a _{1}+a_{3} a _{2}\right)\right)\right]
\end{array}
\]</span> We now particularize at <span class="math inline">\(k = K -\)</span> the point for which the nearest-neighbor matrix element vanishes. Since <span class="math display">\[
e^{i 3 K \cdot a _{i}}=\left(e^{i K \cdot a _{i}}\right)^{3}=1
\]</span> for <span class="math inline">\(i=1,2\)</span>, we see that the off-diagonal matrix element at <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is <span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{c}
e^{i k \cdot \delta_{3}}\left(e^{i K \cdot\left(a_{1} a _{1}+a_{2} a _{2}\right)}+e^{i K \cdot\left(a_{1} a _{2}+a_{3} a _{1}\right)}+e^{i K \cdot\left(a_{2} a _{1}+a_{3} a _{2}\right)}\right) \\
=e^{i k \cdot \delta_{3}}\left(z^{2 a_{1}+a_{2}}+z^{2 a_{3}+a_{1}}+z^{2 a_{2}+a_{3}}\right)
\end{array}
\]</span> Because we know <span class="math inline">\(a_{i} \in 0,1,2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}=1 \quad\)</span> mod <span class="math inline">\(\quad 3\)</span>, we can have only three distinct combinations of the numbers <span class="math inline">\(a_{i} .\)</span> First, <span class="math inline">\(a_{1}=0, a_{2}=0, a_{3}=1:\)</span> the matrix element is <span class="math inline">\(z^{0}+z^{2}+z=0 .\)</span> Second, <span class="math inline">\(a_{1}=1, a_{2}=1, a_{3}=2\)</span> : the matrix element is <span class="math inline">\(z^{3}+z^{5}+z^{4}=1+z^{2}+z=0\)</span> Third, <span class="math inline">\(a_{1}=0, a_{2}=2, a_{3}=2\)</span> : the matrix element is <span class="math inline">\(z^{2}+z^{4}+z^{6}=z^{2}+z+1=0\)</span>. Permutations of these three values of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> obviously do not make a difference.</p>
<p>We hence proved that the matrix elements for any <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> hopping vanish at <span class="math inline">\(k = K\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}, T\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> are respected. We can say that the Dirac nodes are locally protected by <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> (we will see that two of them can annihilate and gap out, so they are not globally protected), whereas they are globally protected by <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> symmetry.</p>
<h3 id="breaking-of-c_3-symmetry">2 Breaking of <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> Symmetry</h3>
<p>When <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> symmetry is broken (we assume <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> are unbroken), there is nothing that stops the Dirac points from moving away from <span class="math inline">\(K , K ^{\prime}\)</span>. It is easy to see that in the limit of high anisotropy, the graphene Hamiltonian is fully gapped. For example, for <span class="math inline">\(t_{3} \gg t_{1}, t_{2}\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(h(k)=-t_{3} \sigma_{x}\)</span>, with eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(E=\pm\left|t_{3}\right|\)</span> and a gap equal to <span class="math inline">\(2\left|t_{3}\right| .\)</span> It is hence clear that the absence of <span class="math inline">\(C_{3}\)</span> symmetry spoils the protection of Dirac modes. However, we know that for small anisotropy <span class="math inline">\(t_{c} \approx t_{a} \approx t_{b}\)</span>, the Dirac nodes are stable because of the proof in section 7.4.1. How do the Dirac nodes gap?</p>
<p>In the anisotropic case, Dirac nodes come at points <span class="math inline">\(K _{0}(\neq K )\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(- K _{0}\)</span> related by TR invariance. As such, as long as <span class="math inline">\(K _{0} \neq- K _{0}\left(\bmod b _{1,2}\right)\)</span>, the Dirac nodes are stable and cannot gap because of the vorticity that they carry. However, when: <span class="math display">\[
K _{0}=- K _{0}\left(\bmod b _{1,2}\right)
\]</span> the two Dirac points of vorticity <span class="math inline">\(\pm \pi\)</span> meet up and can annihilate, as in figure <span class="math inline">\(7.4\)</span>, at a TRinvariant point. The Hamiltonian at the point at which the Dirac nodes annihilate is quadratic (or flat) in the momentum multiplying one Pauli matrix and linear in the other. This has to be so for several reasons. First, the dispersion cannot be linear in both Pauli matrices because the wavefunction would then exhibit vorticity. We know this is not the case because the Dirac nodes annihilate, and the end result is a gapped Hamiltonian with zero vorticity. The second way of seeing this is the following: with <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, the Hamiltonian for graphene takes the form <span class="math display">\[
h( k )=d_{x}( k ) \sigma_{x}+d_{y}( k ) \sigma_{y}+\epsilon( k )
\]</span> with no <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{z}\)</span> term. The <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon( k )\)</span> term is diagonal and, hence, does not influence the spectral gap, so we drop it in the further discussion. The time reversal <span class="math inline">\(\left(h(- k )=h^{*}( k )\right)\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(d_{x}(- k )=d_{x}( k )\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(d_{y}(- k )=-d_{y}( k )\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon( k )=\epsilon(- k ) .\)</span> At a <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> -invariant point <span class="math inline">\(K_{0}\)</span>, where the two Dirac nodes finally touch as anisotropy is increased, we have <span class="math inline">\(K _{0}=- K _{0}\left(\bmod b _{1,2}\right)\)</span>, which means <span class="math display">\[
d_{x}\left( K _{0}\right)=d_{x}\left(- K _{0}\right) ; \quad d_{y}\left( K _{0}\right)=d_{y}\left(- K _{0}\right)=-d_{y}\left( K _{0}\right)=0 .
\]</span> We now see that only <span class="math inline">\(d_{x}\)</span> is present in the Hamiltonian at <span class="math inline">\(k = K _{0}\)</span>. Infinite-simally away from a <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> -invariant point <span class="math inline">\(k = K _{0}+\delta k\)</span>, we have <span class="math display">\[
d_{x}\left( K _{0}+\delta k \right)=d_{x}\left(- K _{0}-\delta k \right)=d_{x}\left( K _{0}-\delta k \right) .
\]</span> gives Fourier-transforming to first order gives <span class="math display">\[
d_{x}\left( K _{0}\right)+\left.\delta k _{i} \frac{\partial d_{x}}{\partial k_{i}}\right|_{k=K_{0}}=d_{x}\left( K _{0}\right)-\left.\delta k _{i} \frac{\partial d_{x}}{\partial k}\right|_{k=K_{0}},
\]</span> so the first order is missing: <span class="math inline">\(\left.\frac{\partial d_{x}}{\partial k_{i}}\right|_{k=K_{0}}=0\)</span> and <span class="math display">\[
\left.d_{y}\left( K _{0}+\delta k \right) \approx \delta k _{i} \frac{\partial d_{y}}{\partial k_{i}}\right|_{k=K_{0}}
\]</span> The Hamiltonian is then <span class="math display">\[
\left.h\left( K _{0}+\delta k \right) \approx \delta k _{i} \frac{\partial d_{y}}{\partial k_{i}}\right|_{k=K_{0}} \sigma_{y}+\left.\delta k _{i} \delta k _{j} \frac{\partial^{2} d_{x}}{\partial k_{i} \partial k_{j}}\right|_{k=K_{0}} \sigma_{x}+d_{x}\left( K _{0}\right),
\]</span> with gap <span class="math inline">\(2\left|d_{x}\left( K _{0}\right)\right| .\)</span> When the Dirac nodes are touching, the gap is <span class="math inline">\(2\left|d_{x}\left( K _{0}\right)\right|=0 .\)</span> At the touching point, the Hamiltonian is linear in one direction but quadratic in the other. We want to stress that the preceding scenario for the gapping of Dirac nodes is absolutely necessary: for high anisotropy, the band structure is gapped,and for low anisotropy it is gapless, so there must be a place in between where the gap opens. Because the gapless Dirac nodes are locally stable (as proved earlier), to open a gap we need to bring them together first and annihilate them. This happens only at a <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> -invariant point.</p>
<h2 id="edge-modes-of-the-graphene-layer">Edge Modes of the Graphene Layer</h2>
<p>So far in this chapter we have analyzed graphene with periodic boundary conditions and have focused on the symmetries of the problem and the stability of Dirac points. It turns out that graphene exhibits spectacular physics not only for the bulk (periodic boundary conditions), but also for the edge. We now focus on the new physics that arises in graphene once edges are placed on the sample. We will see that a careful analysis of this situation strongly hints to the existence of the first topological insulator, the Chern insulator.</p>
<p>We analyze one graphene layer with edges on it. Instead of the transfer-matrix method, we will use the direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. As before, the isotropic Hamiltonian is <span class="math display">\[
H=-t \sum_{i \neq j} c_{i}^{\dagger} c_{j}+\text { h.c. }
\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(i, j\)</span> on the hexagonal lattice and where we assume spinless fermions. For fermions with spin, we add an extra spin quantum number. We consider open-boundary conditions in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> -direction and periodic-boundary conditions in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> -direction as in figure <span class="math inline">\(7.5\)</span>, with "zigzag" chains (shown in the figure) oriented at an angle of <span class="math inline">\(\pi / 6\)</span> angle with respect to the horizontal, represented by the color red in figure <span class="math inline">\(7.5\)</span>. Because we have distinct <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> - and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> sites in the unit cell, we can count them along one red chain (fig. 7.5) as even and odd<span class="math inline">\(2 j-1,2 j, 2 j+1,2 j+2, \ldots-\)</span> sites. If we have periodic boundary conditions in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> -direction, we make the Fourier transform <span class="math display">\[
c_{x, y}^{\dagger}=\frac{1}{N_{x}} \sum_{k_{x}} e^{i k_{x} x} c_{k_{x}, y}
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(N_{x}\)</span> is the number of sites in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> -direction. The diagonalization of the Hamiltonian proceeds easily: <span class="math display">\[
H=-t \sum_{j}\left(c_{2 j, k_{x}}^{\dagger} c_{2 j+1, k_{x}}+\text { h.c. }\right)-t \sum_{j}\left(c_{2 j}^{\dagger} c_{2 j-1}\left(e^{i k_{x} \frac{a_{1}}{2}}+e^{-i k_{x} \frac{a_{1}}{2}}\right)+\text { h.c. }\right),
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a_{1}=\frac{a \sqrt{3}}{2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the graphene lattice constant. We make a gauge transformation only on the odd sites <span class="math inline">\(c_{2 j-1} \rightarrow c_{2 j-1} e^{i k_{x} a_{1} 2}\)</span> in the same way that we did before for the periodic Hamiltonian, obtaining <span class="math display">\[
H=-t \sum_{j}\left(c_{2 j, k_{x}}^{\dagger} c_{2 j+1, k_{x}}+c_{2 j, k_{x}}^{\dagger} c_{2 j-1, k_{x}}\left(1+e^{-i k_{x} a_{1}}\right)+\text { h.c. }\right)
\]</span> Hence the hopping, in ascending order, from odd to even sites <span class="math inline">\((2 j-1 \rightarrow 2 j)\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(t^{\prime}=t(1+\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(\left.e^{-i k_{x} a_{1}}\right)=t \cdot t_{k}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(t_{k}=1+e^{-i k_{x} a_{1}}\)</span> as in figure 7.6. At <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}=\pi / a_{1}\)</span>, the hopping is <span class="math inline">\(t^{\prime}=0\)</span>, and hence we have two different situations, depending on whether the zigzag chain contains an even or odd number of sites. We analyze these cases separately next.</p>
<h3 id="chains-with-even-number-of-sites">1 Chains with Even Number of Sites</h3>
<p>For a chain with an even number of sites <span class="math inline">\(2 L_{y}\)</span> (an integer) in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> -direction, where site 1 is on an <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> sublattice (these conditions guarantee that site <span class="math inline">\(2 L_{y}\)</span> is on an <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> sublattice), we have that the two sites at the end of the chain do not couple with the dimerized bulk at <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}=\pi / a_{1} .\)</span> In this case, we see that the states <span class="math display">\[
\left|\psi_{1}\right\rangle=c_{1, \pi / a_{1}}^{\dagger}|0\rangle, \quad\left|\psi_{2}\right\rangle=c_{2 L_{y}, \pi / a_{1}}^{\dagger}|0\rangle
\]</span> have <span class="math inline">\(E=0\)</span> energy in the Hamiltonian and are, hence, zero edge modes. At <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}=\pi / a_{1}\)</span>, these two states are exactly at energy <span class="math inline">\(0 ;\)</span> the bulk is completely dimerized, as in figure <span class="math inline">\(7.7\)</span>. Away from the point <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}=\pi / a_{1}\)</span>, the edge modes have dispersion, but in the limit <span class="math inline">\(L_{y} \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, the edge modeenergies go to zero. This can be seen by taking the single-particle wavefunction, <span class="math inline">\(|\psi\rangle=\sum_{i} a_{i}|i\rangle\)</span>, and diagonalizing the Hamiltonian to obtain <span class="math display">\[
t_{k}^{*} a_{2 j-1}+a_{2 j+1}=\frac{E}{-t} a_{2 j}, \quad t_{k} a_{2 j}+a_{2 j-2}=\frac{E}{-t} a_{2 j-1},
\]</span> Two (quasi) zero-energy modes are present.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First, the mode localized close to the <span class="math inline">\(j=1\)</span> edge: for <span class="math inline">\(E \approx 0\)</span> we obtain</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{a_{2 j+1}}{a_{2 j-1}}=-t_{k}^{*} ; \quad a_{2 j}=0 \text { for all } j
\]</span></p>
<p>with the solution <span class="math display">\[
a_{2 j+1}=\left(-t_{k}^{*}\right)^{j} a_{1}
\]</span> It is rather clear that this is an edge mode as long as <span class="math inline">\(t_{k} \neq 1\)</span>. Normally, we would say that both <span class="math inline">\(t_{k}&gt;1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t_{k}&lt;1\)</span> are edge modes-localized on different edges-but this is not true. The reasoning is the following: we have assumed that the energy of the edge mode is <span class="math inline">\(E=0\)</span> everywhere in <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}\)</span> -space, even though, for modes away from <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}=\pi\)</span>, the energy disperses on the order of <span class="math inline">\(\exp \left(-L_{y}\right)\)</span> (infinitesimal dispersion as we go to the thermodynamic limit but, nonetheless, still dispersion). The reason for this infinitesimal dispersion is the <span class="math inline">\(2 L_{y}\)</span> site. The site <span class="math inline">\(2 L_{y}+1\)</span> does not exist, so <span class="math inline">\(a_{2 L_{y}+1}=0 .\)</span> As such, we have that, for <span class="math inline">\(E=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_{2 j}=0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, we get <span class="math display">\[
t_{k}^{*} a_{2 L_{y}-1}+a_{2 L_{y}+1}=\frac{E}{-t} a_{2 L_{y}}=0=t_{k}^{*} a_{2 L_{y}-1}
\]</span> Unless <span class="math inline">\(t_{k}=0\)</span> (which happens only at <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}=\pi\)</span>, equation (7.52) requires <span class="math inline">\(a_{2 L_{y}-1} \rightarrow 0\)</span>. This means that the solution <span class="math inline">\(a_{2 j+1}=\left(-t_{k}^{*}\right)^{j} a_{1}\)</span> works only for <span class="math inline">\(t_{k}&lt;1\)</span>, which is the same as <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2 \pi}{3} \leq k_{x} a_{1} \leq \frac{4 \pi}{3}\)</span>. These are exactly the Dirac points in graphene in terms of <span class="math inline">\(k_{x} .\)</span> This represents an edge mode localized on the <span class="math inline">\(j=1\)</span> edge of energy <span class="math inline">\(E \rightarrow 0\)</span> in the thermodynamic limit. Second, the mode localized on the <span class="math inline">\(j=2 L_{y}\)</span> edge is obtained if <span class="math display">\[
\frac{a_{2 j-2}}{a_{2 j}}=-t_{k} ; \quad a_{2 j+1}=0 \forall j
\]</span> which has as solution <span class="math display">\[
a_{2 L_{y}-2 j}=\left(-t_{k}\right)^{j} a_{2 L_{y}}
\]</span> Again, we have that <span class="math inline">\(-t_{k} a_{2}=0\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(a_{2} \rightarrow 0\)</span>, which means <span class="math inline">\(\left|t_{k}\right|&lt;1\)</span>, with identical conditions on <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, as before. This is a mode localized at the <span class="math inline">\(j=2 L_{y}\)</span> edge of energy <span class="math inline">\(E \rightarrow 0\)</span> in the thermodynamic limit. The discussion of the edge modes just presented is reflected in the form of the Hamiltonian: <span class="math display">\[
h=-t\left[\begin{array}{llllllll}
0 &amp; t_{k} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
t_{k}^{*} &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; t_{k} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; t_{k}^{*} &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; t_{k} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; t_{k}^{*} &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; t_{k} \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; t_{k}^{*} &amp; 0
\end{array}\right],
\]</span> with many sites in between, whose (almost) zero-energy eigenstates are <span class="math display">\[
\psi_{1}=\left(a_{1}, 0, a_{3}, 0, a_{5}, 0, \ldots, a_{2 L_{y}-3}, 0, a_{2 L_{y}-1}, 0\right)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(t_{k}^{*} a_{2 L_{y}-1} \rightarrow 0\)</span> in order to have zero energy and <span class="math display">\[
\psi_{1}=\left(0, a_{2}, 0, a_{4}, 0, a_{6}, \ldots, 0, a_{2 L_{y}-2}, 0, a_{2 L_{y}}\right)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(t_{k} a_{2} \rightarrow 0\)</span> to have zero energy.</p>
<p>We now have a picture for the edge modes in the thermodynamic limit. In the bulk, the bands will be the projection onto the <span class="math inline">\(k_{x}\)</span> -axis of all the band dispersion on <span class="math inline">\(k_{y}\)</span>, so the "bulk" bands will be fat. They will go to zero energy at the Dirac cones, or points. At every point in between the Dirac cones, there will be two, nondispersive edge modes at zero energy, which connect them as in figure <span class="math inline">\(7.8\)</span>. They are localized on one end or the other of the sample, and any local perturbation that could couple the modes on opposite edges cannot lift the degeneracy because it has to go through the whole sample to couple them.</p>
<p>For a chain with an even number of sites <span class="math inline">\(2 L_{y}\)</span> in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> -direction, and with site 1 on the <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> sublattice, site <span class="math inline">\(2 L_{y}\)</span> is guranteed to be on the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> sublattice). Going through a similar calculation, we find edge modes from <span class="math inline">\(\frac{4 \pi}{3}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(2 \pi\)</span> and then continuing from 0 to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2 \pi}{3}\)</span>. The edge modes will be at asymptotically zero energy and can be seen in figure <span class="math inline">\(7.9\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="chains-with-odd-number-of-sites">2 Chains with Odd Number of Sites</h3>
<p>For a chain with an odd number of sites, <span class="math inline">\(2 L_{y}-1\)</span> in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> -direction, if site 1 is on the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> sublattice, then site <span class="math inline">\(2 L_{y}-1\)</span> is also on an <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> sublattice. This case, is of course, identical to the reflected case in which site 1 is site <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and the site at <span class="math inline">\(2 L_{y}-1\)</span> is also <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. In this case, it is easiest to use the matrix form of the Hamiltonian to immediately see the edge modes. As opposed to the case of an even number of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> sites, the Hamiltonian is missing the last column and row: <span class="math display">\[
h=-t\left[\begin{array}{ccccccc}
0 &amp; t_{k} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
t_{k}^{*} &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; t_{k} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; t_{k}^{*} &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; t_{k} &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; t_{k}^{*} &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
\end{array}\right],
\]</span> with many sites in between. Notice that in this case, the wavefunction <span class="math display">\[
\psi_{1}=\left(a_{1}, 0, a_{3}, 0, a_{5}, 0, \ldots, a_{2 L_{y}-3}, 0, a_{2 L_{y}-1}\right)
\]</span> with <span class="math display">\[
a_{2 j+1}=\left(-t_{k}^{*}\right)^{j} a_{1}
\]</span> is always an exact energy solution of the Hamiltonian at any <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(\left|t_{k}\right|&lt;1\)</span> -i.e., for <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> between <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2 \pi}{3}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\frac{4 \pi}{3}\)</span>, the edge state is localized on the 1-site, whereas for <span class="math inline">\(\left|t_{k}\right|&gt;1\)</span> -i.e., in the remainder of the <span class="math inline">\(BZ\)</span> - the state is localized on the <span class="math inline">\(\left(2 L_{y}-1\right)\)</span> -site. This is clearly exemplified in figure <span class="math inline">\(7.10 .\)</span> The edge mode in this case is exactly at zero energy, unlike in the previous case, in which it was split from zero energy by thermodynamically exponential (in <span class="math inline">\(L_{y}\)</span> ) spitting. Notice that the other state that was available in the <span class="math inline">\(2 L_{y}\)</span> chain, <span class="math display">\[
\psi_{1}=\left(0, a_{2}, 0, a_{4}, 0, a_{6}, \ldots ., a_{2 L_{y}-4}, 0, a_{2 L_{y}-2}, 0\right)
\]</span> cannot be a zero-energy state of the system because it would have to satisfy, at the same time, the conditions <span class="math display">\[
t_{k} a_{2} \rightarrow 0 ; \quad a_{2 j}=t_{k} a_{2 j+2} ; \quad a_{2 L_{y}-2} \rightarrow 0
\]</span> whose unique solution is the zero wavevector. The degeneracy of the zero mode at each point, including the special <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> -invariant points, is <span class="math inline">\(1 .\)</span> This clearly shows that we are dealing with systems with spinless fermions for which time reversal does not induce Kramers' degeneracy.</p>
<h3 id="influence-of-different-mass-terms-on-the-graphene-edge-modes">3 Influence of Different Mass Terms on the Graphene Edge Modes</h3>
<p>We now ask what happens to the edge modes upon opening a gap at the Dirac nodes. In the spinless case, several possibilities appear.</p>
<h4 id="case-1">Case 1:</h4>
<p>First, we can add a term that gives different energies to lattice sites <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, as in the case of BN. As before, this term is <span class="math display">\[
h(k)=m \sigma_{z}
\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(m&gt;0 ; m\)</span> is called an inversion symmetry breaking mass, or Semenoff mass [39]. We ask how the gap opens. The edge modes that terminate (have high amplitude) on sites <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> will go up in energy, whereas the edge modes that terminate on sites <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> will go down in energy. We hence have the situations in figures 7.11, 7.12, <span class="math inline">\(7.13\)</span> and 7.14, depending on whether the terminations are <span class="math inline">\(A-B, B-A, A-A\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(B-B\)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="case-2">Case 2:</h4>
<p>We now add a term that breaks time reversal and gaps the system. This is called a Haldane mass; because we do not yet know how to add it on the lattice, we add it at the level of the Dirac fermion mass, which, per sections <span class="math inline">\(7.3 .2\)</span> and 7.3.1, means we need to add a mass of opposite sign to the Dirac fermions at <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(K ^{\prime}\)</span>. This mass term is a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> -space-dependent term, which cannot be looked at as a term that adds energy on localized sites. It is not an on-site term. As such, the edge modes will do completely different things than in the case of a BN-type (inversion-breaking) mass. We have seen that in the inversion-breaking case, the edge modes remain linked to the Dirac mass; i.e., the mass is identical at both cones, and the edge modes still connect the cones on the same side of the gap. In the <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> -breaking case, a similar thing happens, but because the mass is negative at one cone and positive at the other cone, the edge modes will connect one cone with another by crossing the gap, as in figures 7.15-7.18. The Hall conductance can be inferred if we know where the edge modes in the figure are situated (i.e., on which side of the Laughlin cylinder), but it can be only <span class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span>. Thus, it is clear that a topological insulator with nonzero Hall conductance and that maintains lattice translational symmetry exists. We will find one in the next chapter.</p>
